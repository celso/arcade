This repo will host the scripts, patches and global configuration used in my arcade machine replica.

My hardware setup:
------------------

PC:
---

. Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz
. GeForce4 MX 440 AGP 8x]
. TS32GSSD25-M, Transcend 32 GB, 2.5 Inch 44-Pin standard IDE/ATA disk

Arcade control panel
--------------------

All of my controls were bought at Ultimarc http://www.ultimarc.com/

They're a bit expensive but they're really good, trust me. Here's the list of controls I have right now:

. 1 Spintrak http://www.ultimarc.com/SpinTrak.htm (great to play Arkanoid)
. 2 Mag-Stik plus joysticks http://www.ultimarc.com/controls.html
. 11 classic pushbuttons, 1up, 2up, 3 buttons per joystick, lateral buttons to play pinball too.
. 1 U-trak trackball http://www.ultimarc.com/trackball.html (great to play Marble Madness, or the use it as a mouse in UAE)
. 1 I-pac PC interface to connect the buttons http://www.ultimarc.com/ipac1.html
. 1 Coin Mech, properly working and tuned to Portuguese coins http://www.ultimarc.com/controls.html

TV
--

The TV is an old Mitsai CRT tube. It has RGB lines active in the scart connector. A good TV will switch to RGB mode automatically when it detects signal, it will also save settings like sound volume and color adjustments.

VGA to RGB adaptor
------------------

This adaptor converts the VGA signals from the GPU to the TV RGB lines. 

The GeForce4 will be sending 15Khz ready modes throught the VGA connector so all it needs to do is to combine the v/h syncs to composite sync and adapt a few scart lines. I'm using the more reliable 74HC86 version. Here's the page with the schematics:

Hardware notes:
---------------

The arcade cabinet is made of wood, so the resonance from the PC usage can make a lot of noise. Use silent fans and SSD or CF card based disks for best results.

IDE adaptors are hard to find these days, bought mine at http://www.dealextreme.com/p/3-5-to-2-5-hdd-converter-727

The old GeForce4 MX is key to my setup, as it supports native 15Khz TV modes under the VGA connector. Ebay is your friend.
