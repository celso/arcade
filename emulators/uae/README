UAE, the Amiga Emulator, runs under the libsvga device.

I'm using a patched version of e-uae-0.8.29-WIP4. For more info check:

http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae/

The patch is ugly but works. It allows me to map each game keys to my own aracde control panel, using a per-game configuration file at runtime. See patches/

start.sh is invoked by advmenu and does all the magic to run a game, this includes two main tasks:

1. Copies the game to the WBStartup folder so that it starts when UAE runs
2. Copies the keymaps and specific settings for each game in games/gameid
3. Runs uae, boots workbench

A few config files are included here as examples under game/*
