UAE, the Amiga Emulator, runs under the framebuffer device.

start.sh is invoked by advmenu and does all the magic to run a game, this includes two main tasks:

1. Copies the game to the WBStartup folder so that it starts when UAE runs
2. Copies the keymaps and specific settings for each game in games/gameid
3. Runs uae, boots workbench

A few config files are included here as examples under game/*
