We use AdvanceMenu and AdvanceMame extensively which "contains projects related to play Arcade and PC games with video hardware like TVs, Arcade monitors, PC monitors and LCD screens. They run in GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, DOS and Windows."

It's 2011 and imho this suite is still the best out there if you want to run your arcade replica under a Linux based setup.

This is how I've compiled them:

advancemenu-2.4.13/configure --prefix=/servers/mame/ --enable-svgalib
advancemame-0.106.0/configure --prefix=/servers/mame --enable-svgalib --enable-alsa

Yes, it's 2011 and I'm using libsvga. Guess what, works fine with my 15Khz PAL CRT and the Geforce4 GPU. Native drivers don't.
